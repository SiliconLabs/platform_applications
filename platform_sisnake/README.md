A snake game for Giant Gecko GG11 started kit.

## Summary ##
A simple snake game for Giant Gecko GG11 started kit inspired by the old-school Snake2. There is a snake controlled by the player with btn0(left) and btn1(right). The goal is to make as many points as possible, by eating food randomly spawn at the game field. The snake will be longer with every piece of food it eats. The game is over when the head of the snake collides with a wall, or with its own body.
The main logic of the app is achieved with a state machine driven by interrupts.
