label: Platform - Linked DMA (LDMA) Arbitration
description: |
  This project demonstrates various arbitration configurations of multiple transfers, each consisting of 256 words transferred from WTIMER0â†’CNT to memory buffers.
  Transfers are configured to arbitrate after 32 words. Arbitration changes order in which data is copied.
  After transfer, the order is reconstructed and shown on Virtual COM.
