## Summary ##

This project generates a 0.5 Hz squarewave on PA11 while in EM3 and wakes on an interrupt at 977 mHz to toggle PA11 which is connected to the EXTCOMIN pin of the display on the GG11 STK.  Application goes into EM3 after setup.

Peripherals used: CRYOTIMER, EMU

## Gecko SDK version ##

v2.7

## Hardware Required ##

- One SLSTK3701A Giant Gecko GG11 Starter Kit
<https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/mcu/32-bit/efm32-giant-gecko-gg11-starter-kit>

## Setup ##

Import the included .sls file to Studio then build and flash the project to the SLSTK3701A STK.
In Simplicity Studio select "File->Import" and navigate to the directory with the .sls project file.
The project is built with relative paths to the STUDIO_SDK_LOC variable which was defined as

C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v4\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v2.7

## How the Project Works ##

The intent is to provide an example of how to use the cryotimer to provide LCD display with a low power the EXTCOMIN signal it requires.  If the display EXTMODE pin is HIGH the polarity inversion is armed for every rising edge of the EXTCOMIN pin. The toggling frequency should be at least 1 Hz. If EXTMODE is LOW this pin is ignored.

## .sls Projects Used ##

mcu_peripheral_cryotimer_gg11.sls

## How to Port to Another Part ##

Open the "Project Properties" and navigate to the "C/C++ Build -> Board/Part/SDK" item.  Select the new board or part to target and "Apply" the changes.  Note: there may be dependencies that need to be resolved when changing the target architecture.
