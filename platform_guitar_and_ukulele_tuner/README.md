## Summary ##

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the Giant Gecko GG11 started kit to implement a sound-based guitar and ukulele tuner. This example is implemented in the SLSTK3701A starter kit for the EFM32GG11 MCU. Multiple on-board hardware elements are leveraged such as the MEMS microphones, push-buttons, and LCD screen; MCU peripherals such as the PRS, GPIO interrupts, USART (I2S mode), CMU and LDMA. Core-specific peripherals like the DSP, FPU, and NVIC are also utilized. [Figure 1](#figure-1) below shows a high-level functional block representation of the project, each block is marked by a green background.
